Title:
"Using High Frequency Chlorophyll-a Monitoring Sensors to Determine Differences in Temporal Patterns at Two Locations in the North-Inlet Winyah Bay Estuarine Ecosystem"

Project Description:
I will be using high-frequency chl-a field data that I have collected previously and retroactive Chl-a/water quality data(e.g. salinity, turbidity,temperature, CDOM, etc.) from the North Inlet-Winyah Bay NERR. I want to determine the fluctuations in Chl-a over a variety of temporal scales, mainly seasonal, tidal, and yearly. I also would like to look at the relationship between these chl-a flucutations and fluctuations of the water quality parameters listed above(salinity, turbidity,temperature). Using R, I would like to create clear and aesthetic figures to show these temporal patterns. I would also potentially like to run some time-series analyses/appropriate data analyses to see if there is a significant difference between the averages of chl-a data that is collected at a high frequency(in this case, every 15 minutes), and the average of chl-a data that is collected at a low frequency (every 2 weeks), which is what was previously done at the NI-WB National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Data Source/ Description:
I collected some of the data I will be using myself from a previous summer internship at the NI-WB NERR. The retroactive data I will be getting from the NERR/NOAA centralized data management office from the specific NERR site I worked at (North Inlet-Winyah Bay). Some of the data yearly water quality parameters/chl-a that was recorded every 15 minutes by an automatic sampler. Some of the other data is chl-a data that was sampled by hand every 2 weeks. This is the data I want to use to compare to the chl-a data that was collected every 15 minutes to see if there is a significant difference in chl-a variability between the two different sampling frequencies

3 questions:
1) What are the temporal variabilties in chl-a on tidal, seasonal, and yearly scales.
2) What are the tempral variabilites in chl-a between two different field sites in the Estuarine ecosystem (Ocean dominated Inlet vs. River dominated Bay)
3) How much variability is missed between sampling every two weeks vs. sampling every 15 minutes.
